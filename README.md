⛔ Generative Fill or AI online features DO NOT WORK

You can forget about it without a valid subscription or active trial (7 days). It’s been adapted into the monthly credits service for valid subscription users (pay-wall). Therefore, it's gone forever.

 

⚠️ Any ongoing new changes or fixes might not be immediately reflected in either the tools or the written guides (we’re people and have lives, too), but we will try our best to update it ASAP.



##1. Download & Install Creative Cloud

If you get a .dmg file when you download Creative Cloud, it's likely because you're using Opera, which tells Adobe that you're on a Mac (for some reason). Use a different browser.

You can Create a free account using your email or a temporary email (search on Google “temp mail” and any should work), or use an account you already have, preferably without any ongoing subscription (to avoid problems)

During setup, if shown do NOT install AGS (Adobe Genuine Service), if not shown, continue anyway

Once installed go to Menu > File > Preferences and in the "General" tab disable the following:
```
Launch at login
Sync files in the background after quitting
Automatically keep it updated
```
Once that is done go Menu > File > Exit Creative Cloud
 

##2. Download the latest GenP in the guide - Extract ALL contents from zip

Once you have the .zip file, Right-click and “Extract All” contents.

 

⚠️Possible Problem & Solution - Step 2

⚠️ Anti-virus programs may sometimes delete or move files into quarantine. You can either whitelist GenP as safe or disable Anti-virus while extracting. This will fix the issue of .exe not showing in the folder after extraction.

 

##3. Patch CreativeCloud with “Patch CC” button

Using the current version of GenP, press the button that says “Patch CC.”

The patch runs automatically and performs all the necessary actions (Do not touch anything until done)

In rare cases, GenP fails to find your CC installation automatically. If this happens, you’ll have to select the files manually; they are located in these directories:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\AppsPanel

C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\ADS

You will know it’s finished when it switches to the log menu (this is only informational; continue with the guide)

 

⚠️Possible Problem & Solution - Step 3

⚠️ If you get “M2-Team NSUDO Launcher - Error: Failed to create a process”, the mouse cursor gets stuck as a loading spinner, or GenP doesn’t open:

Make sure you're using the latest GenP, it should ask you a Yes or No question on start-up, press "No". If it opens now, continue following the guide.

 

💁‍♂️ Every time CC gets updated, you must apply the “Patch CC” again.

 

 

##4. Open Creative Cloud > Apps > Install

On the side menu, if you click on “Apps”

You should now have the install button. Install all the apps you want, wait until everything is installed, and DON’T OPEN ANY YET.

Once everything you want is installed, go to Menu > File > Exit Creative Cloud



 

##5. Run GenP on the installed apps

Open GenP folder > Run "AdobeGenP.exe"

Click on the button "Search" and wait. (it will look at the default locations in C:) - (The “Path” is if apps were installed somewhere else; most likely, you’ll never need to use this option)

You can de-select the respective paths if you have any programs you don’t want to patch.

Finally, click on the button “PATCH” to run the patch on the apps and wait until it’s done.

 

⚠️Possible Problem & Solution - Step 5

⚠️ If you’re having issues opening it, turn AntiVirus OFF and try again; however, don’t forget to turn it back ON after it’s patched.

 

💁‍♂️ Every time the apps get updated, you must apply the “Patch” on the respective apps again.

 

 

6. OPEN THE APPS THROUGH THEIR .EXE and NOT FROM Creative Cloud directly;

Be aware that you are free to pin apps and open them from the taskbar, start, .exe, shortcut, etc. The important part is: Don’t open CC just to click OPEN on Photoshop, for example.

Everything should be working now! End of Guide.
